  "readme": "Serialize\n==============\n\nA simple node utility to serialize execution of asynchronous functions.\n\n## What does it do?\n\nAsynchrony in nodejs is great, except that it makes your code looks horrible because of all the callbacks. If you use synchronous functions, which give you good-looking, easy-to-read code, they will block the thread and make your server not responsive.\n\nHere's `serailize` to the rescue! `serialize` converts your asynchronous functions into serialized versions. Serialized functions are executed one after another, without explicitly chaining them with callback functions. `serialize` does __NOT__ execute the function synchronously (block the thread), it just serialize the execution of asynchronous functions. So that it makes the code looks synchronous, but it is actually ascynhronous underneath.\n\n## How to use it?\n\nTo create a serialized version of an asynchronous function, call `serialize` with it. For example, if you want to make serialized versions of `fs.writeFile` and `fs.mkdir`, you do:\n```javascript\nvar serialize = require('serialize');\n\nfs.mkdir = serialize(fs.mkdir);\nfs.writeFile = serialize(fs.writeFile);\n```\nThen, you can use `fs.mkdir` and `fs.writeFile` like they are synchronous functions:\n```javascript\nfs.mkdir('new');\nfs.mkdir('new/folder');\nfs.writeFile('new/folder/hello.txt', \"hello world\", callback);\n```\nThese function will be executed one after another, but they will not block the thread as their synchronous versions do. The `callback` will be invoked after the last call completes.\n\nIf you want to restore `fs.writeFile` and `fs.mkdir` to their original version, just do:\n```javascript\nfs.mkdir = fs.mkdir.free();\nfs.writeFile = fs.writeFile.free();\n```\n\n### What if an error happens? \n\nIf an error happens, the error will be passed to the corresponding callback function, and the execution of all serialized calls after it will be aborted. If an error happens in a function call that does not have a callback, the error will be passed down to the first call that has a callback function. \nFor example, if the `fs.mkdir('new')` call in the above code throws an error, because there's no callback attached to that call, the error will be passed down to the callback of `fs.writeFile(...)`. And, of course, `fs.mkdir('new/folder')` and `fs.writeFile(...)` won't be executed because an error occurred before them.\n\n### What's more to it?\n\nIf you want to serialize calls to file system, and serialize calls to database, but allow calls to file system and calls to database to happen concurrently, how to do it? \nYou can serialize different functions into different queues. Functions belong to the same queue will be executed in serial, but functions between different queues can run concurrently. \nTo serialize a function to a queue other than the default queue, give a queue name as the second argument of `serialize`:\n```javascript\nconn.query = serialize(conn.query, \"db\");\n```\n\n### Is any function *serializable*?\n\nCurrent version of `serialize` can only serialize a function that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. It accepts a callback function, and invokes the callback when it is done;\n2. If an error occurs, it must invoke callback with the error as the first argument; the error must be an instance of `Error`.\n\nNote: Future version of `serialize` may be able to serialize a function that emits `end` and `error` events.\n\n## License - MIT\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Chaoran Yang (chaoran@rice.edu)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
